## > Hello!

I'm Elias, a software developer with an interest in programming languages, systems programming, and developer tooling.

## > What's up?

Right now I'm a staff engineer at Township, a software agency specializing in software for Bluetooth devices and medical interfaces.

Previously I participated in the winter 2024 batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

In my free time I'm currently working on [Possum](https://github.com/mulias/possum_parser_language), a compact programming language for parsing text into JSON.
