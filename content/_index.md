## Hello!

I'm Elias, a software developer with an interest in programming languages and developer tooling.

## What I'm up to

I'm at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), taking some time to work on projects I'm excited about and collaborate with cool folks.

Currently my focus is on contributing to the [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) programming language and growing the ecosystem around Roc.

I've also been working on [Possum](https://github.com/mulias/possum_parser_language), a tiny programming language for parsing arbitrary text into JSON.

As I pick up smaller projects and reach interesting milestones I'll be writing about it [over here](/blog/).
